## Key Innovations
### Next-Level Designer

Reacon introduces a secure, real-time communication system with Drishti via WebSockets. This eliminates the need for frequent server pings, enabling:

* **Efficient Resource Monitoring**: Real-time updates over a single, secure channel.
* **Enhanced Commands**: Drishti can now perform module-specific restarts without rebooting the entire device, ensuring uninterrupted operations.


### Real-Time Monitoring and Alerts
* **Modernized Dashboards**: A sleek, user-friendly interface packed with advanced charts displays the real-time status of Raspberry Pi devices powering the digital boards.
* **Self-Configured Alerts**: Owners can now set custom alerts for device issues like going offline, reducing dependency on support teams.


### Streamlined Administration
* **Subscription Management**: Renew subscriptions and purchase additional licenses directly within the app.
* **Built-in Invoice System**: Integrated invoicing for seamless financial management.
* **Fault Tolerance**: Robust logging and fault-handling mechanisms for quick issue resolution.
